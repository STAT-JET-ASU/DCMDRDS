## Before We Begin...

These slides are not meant to be standalone information. You should take notes to flesh out the contents. I recommend that you create an R Markdown document where you can combine information and code from the slides and your own additional notes and explorations to make connections.

## Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

We need `tidyverse` for all our basic data manipulation. Recall that this includes `dplyr` and `ggplot`, among other packages in the `tidyverse` suite of tools.

```{r}
library(moderndive)
```

We need `moderndive` for some of the data and functions used in the sampling bowl activity. 

```{r}
library(gridExtra)
```

We need `gridExtra` to arrange and display multiple plots.


## Our Population: The "Bowl"

What proportion of the balls are red? We could count all of them (take a *census*), but that would be a long process.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="MD Figure 7.1: A bowl filled with red and white balls.", out.width='600'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0868c64eb2998fbe3e3bfccf7ff55e746341baf3/eeab1/images/sampling/balls/sampling_bowl_1.jpg")
```


## Our Sample: The "Shovel"

Instead of counting the entire population (*census*), we can select a random sample to use as an estimate.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="MD Figure 7.3: Removing 50 balls from the bowl.", out.width='600'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ee8292df457bd73d7a1a7d75c21be32d6e8659d6/30e62/images/sampling/balls/sampling_bowl_3_cropped.jpg")
```


## Random Sampling

Assuming there are more than 50 red balls and 50 white balls, when we take a random sample of 50 balls from the bowl we *could* get anywhere from 0 to 50 red balls (or a proportion of 0.00 = 0% to 1.00 = 100%). In other words, all proportions are *possible*. But are they all equally *probable*? Why or why not?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='300'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tap-to-speak.gif")
```


## Virtual Sampling

We cannot physically replicate this experiment, but we can do so virtually. The `moderndive` package contains a virtual object `bowl` that represents the physical object. Scoop one `virtual_shovel` of balls using the following code.

```{r}
virtual_shovel <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 1)
```

The `rep_sample_n()` function is in package the `moderndive`.

    rep_sample_n(tbl, size, replace = FALSE, reps = 1, prob = NULL)
    
Defaults are sampling *without* replacement, equal probability of being selected, and one repetition of the chosen size.


## Proportion of Red Balls

The proportion of red balls in your sample is an *estimate* of the proportion of red balls in the `bowl`. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
virtual_shovel %>% 
  mutate(is_red = (color == "red")) %>% 
  summarize(num_red  = sum(is_red),
            prop_red = mean(is_red)) 
```

Note that the code is slightly different than the code found in Modern Dive, Chapter 7. This code is algebraically equivalent, but automatically works for sample sizes other than 50.  

What if we wanted to calculate the proportion of white balls in the sample? How would you adapt the code?

<p style = "text-align: center; color: red; font-weight: bold;">GIVE IT A TRY!</p>


## Results of My Sample

Here are the results of my sample. What should the numbers of red and white balls add up to? What about the proportions?

```{r}
virtual_shovel %>% 
  mutate(is_red = (color == "red"),
         is_white = (color == "white")) %>% 
  summarize(num_red  = sum(is_red),
            prop_red = mean(is_red),
            num_white = sum(is_white),
            prop_white = mean(is_white))
```


## Taking Multiple Samples

In the physical scenario described in Modern Dive, there were 33 students in the class, each of whom drew one sample from the physical `bowl`. Their results are shown below. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 3.75}
class_plot <- ggplot(tactile_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.5, color = "white", fill = "skyblue") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.10),
                     limits = c(0, 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of 33 Sample Proportions of Red Balls",
       subtitle = "tactile sampling",
       x = "Proportion of Balls That Were Red (sample size n = 50)", 
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_linedraw()
class_plot
```


## True Proportion of Red

What seems like the most probable value for $p$ = proportion of red balls in the `bowl`, based on the plot of 33 samples? Why?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='300'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tap-to-speak.gif")
```

(We *could* calculate it directly, but in most real-life scenarios we cannot. Exploring cases where the solution is known is how we develop reliable methods for unknown cases.)


## Virtually Replicate the 33 Samples

Thanks to the power of computers, you can replicate the class sampling process. Set the `reps` to 33 so you get one sample of size 50 for each virtual student. 

```{r}
virtual_samples <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 33)
```

Calculate the count and proportion of red balls in each sample (`replicate`).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
virtual_prop_red <- virtual_samples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  mutate(is_red = (color == "red")) %>% 
  summarize(num_red  = sum(is_red),
            prop_red = mean(is_red)) 
```


##

```{r}
virtual_prop_red <- virtual_samples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  mutate(is_red = (color == "red")) %>% 
  summarize(num_red  = sum(is_red),
            prop_red = mean(is_red)) 
virtual_prop_red %>% head(n = 8)  # I only have room for a few rows
```


## Tactile vs. Virtual Results #1

Tactile results will always be the same. Virtual results will differ unless we `set.seed()` to control our pseudo-random stream.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4.1}
sim_plot <- ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, 
                 boundary = 0.5, 
                 color = "white", 
                 fill = "skyblue") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.10),
                     limits = c(0, 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of 33 Sample Proportions of Red Balls",
       subtitle = "virtual sampling",
       x = "Proportion of Balls That Were Red (sample size n = 50)", 
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_linedraw()

grid.arrange(class_plot, sim_plot)
```


## Sampling Distribution

We need to understand the *sampling distribution* of the statistic we are using to estimate a population value. What is the shape, center, and spread (variability)?

Usually we characterize center and spread using mean and SD. Can you tell the shape from the plot?

```{r}
virtual_prop_red %>% 
  summarize(mean_props = mean(prop_red),
            sd_props = sd(prop_red))
```


## Taking More Samples!

Our 33 random samples are not very many if we are trying to understand the true variability that can occur from sample to sample. Let's take more samples!

Adapt the code to take 1000 samples of size 50. Summarize the count and proportion of red balls in each sample and save it as the object `virtual_prop_red_1000`.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='300'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tap-to-speak.gif")
```


## 1000 Virtual Samples

```{r}
virtual_prop_red_1000 <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 1000) %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  mutate(is_red = (color == "red")) %>% 
  summarize(num_red  = sum(is_red),
            prop_red = mean(is_red)) 

virtual_prop_red_1000 %>% 
  summarize(mean_props = mean(prop_red),
            sd_props = sd(prop_red))
```


## Virtual Results #2

What shape does your distribution of virtual samples appear to have (approximately)?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4.1}
ggplot(virtual_prop_red_1000, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, 
                 boundary = 0.5, 
                 color = "white", 
                 fill = "skyblue") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.10),
                     limits = c(0, 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of 1000 Sample Proportions of Red Balls",
       subtitle = "virtual sampling",
       x = "Proportion of Balls That Were Red (sample size n = 50)", 
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_linedraw()
```
