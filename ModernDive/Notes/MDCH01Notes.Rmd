### Modern Dive Chapter 1: Getting Started with Data in R

#### Introduction

Before we can start exploring data in R, there are some key concepts to understand first:

* What  are R and RStudio?
* How do I code in R?
* What are R packages?

We’ll introduce these concepts in the upcoming Sections 1.1-1.3. If you are already somewhat familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip to Section 1.4 where we’ll introduce our first dataset: all domestic flights departing one of the three main New York City (NYC) airports in 2013. This is a dataset we will explore in depth for much of the rest of this book.

### Learning Check

<p style="background-color:#9ED3AD; padding: 5px;">**Learning Check Questions**</p>

**(LC1.1)** Repeat the earlier installation steps, but for the `dplyr`, `nycflights13`, and `knitr` packages. This will install the earlier mentioned `dplyr` package for data wrangling, the `nycflights13` package containing data on all domestic flights leaving a NYC airport in 2013, and the `knitr` package for generating easy-to-read tables in `R`. We’ll use these packages in the next section.


**(LC1.2)** “Load” the `dplyr`, `nycflights13`, and `knitr` packages as well by repeating the earlier steps.


**(LC1.3)** What does any *ONE* row in this `flights` dataset refer to?

* A. Data on an airline
* B. Data on a flight
* C. Data on an airport
* D. Data on multiple flights


**(LC1.4)** What are some other examples in this dataset of *categorical* variables? What makes them different than *quantitative* variables?


**(LC1.5)** What properties of each airport do the variables `lat`, `lon`, `alt`, `tz`, `dst`, and `tzone` describe in the airports data frame? Take your best guess.


**(LC1.6)** Provide the names of variables in a data frame with at least three variables where one of them is an identification variable and the other two are not. Further, create your own tidy data frame that matches these conditions.


**(LC1.7)** Look at the help file for the `airports` data frame. Revise your earlier guesses about what the variables `lat`, `lon`, `alt`, `tz`, `dst`, and `tzone` each describe.
